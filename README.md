# Study: Quantifying the impact of load forecasting accuracy on congestion management in distribution grids 

Digitalization is a global trend in energy systems and beyond. However, it is often unclear what digitalization means exactly in the context of energy systems and how the benefits of digitalization can be quantified. Providing additional information, e.g., through sensors and metering equipment, is one concrete angle where digitalization contributes. This study provides a framework to quantify the value of such additional information in distribution grids. We analyze to what extent smart meters improve the accuracy of day-ahead load forecasts and quantify the savings in congestion management costs resulting from the improved accuracy.
